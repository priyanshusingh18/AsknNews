          <h1 class="l-heading">Dumb guy determined to waste his time</h1>

            <p>Failure</p>

          <p class="bold-1">
            The photo above is of a very dumb guy from a small town Ashoknagar, the story of this guy's failure is a cautionary tale for students all across the world. His name is Rahul Raghuwanshi a very dumb guy,
             His ambition was to crack JEE exam and stufy in a prestigious University like IIT, NIT, NSUIT, BITS etc. Rahul did not factor his mental calibar into the equation when he took the decision of pursuing this exam. <br> <br></p>
          <p class="bold-1">His tale started when he was in last year of school, that's when he decided to pursue IIT. In hindsight it is very obvious that he was gonna fail but he thought he can crack the exam
             if he just worked hard and put his best effort.He was never among the toppers of any class, yet he thought he can clear one of the thoughest exam in India.
             He even failed in 10+1 courtesy to spending his time with his dumb friends like Dev, Deepak, Nitin, till date none of them have achived anything of significance, Even after being so dumb he continued
             his pursuit of the impossible. Rahul spends most his time listeing to music or wathcing dumb movies, and yet he thinks he can clear JEE advance. Rahul only scored about 66% in his boards exam of matric, which is a class apart from the topper
             of the school 'Priyanshu' who scored about 90%. Rahul in his junior highschool scored less than 65% which is way below the national average of 67%, His intellect is well below the national average yet he still continues to belive that he can crack IIT.
             He has wasted his time and his father's money on this silly pursuit of the impossible, yet he considers himself a productive member of the society, this goes to show how dumb and ignorant our current genration is,
             taking time and money for-granted is their forte, vicimizing themselves is a second nature to these so-called millenials. It is safe to consider the fact, that if this is our future genration, then we have no future.
              <br><br>
             Every One should choose challenges acording to their calibar, this is the biggest learing someone can take from this story.
